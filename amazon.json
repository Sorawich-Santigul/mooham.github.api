        "I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.",
        "It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging",
        "Value for money, with extra lengthüëç",
        "Good, working fine",
        "Product quality is good",
        "Good, very good",
        "Bought for my daughter's old phone. Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement. I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again. Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price. Can't blame the manufacturer. But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.",
